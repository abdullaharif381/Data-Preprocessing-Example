# Data Science Tasks: Preprocessing and Visualization

This repository contains Python code for performing data preprocessing and visualization tasks on three datasets: Iris, Titanic, and Housing. The tasks include data description, creating histograms/boxplots, handling missing values, and handling outliers.

## Datasets

The code uses the following datasets:

- [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- [Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

## Tasks

The repository includes Python code for the following tasks:

### Question 1: Describing the Data

The code defines a function to analyze features in each dataset, providing statistics such as data type, count, null values, outliers, minimum, maximum, mode, mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

### Question 2: Histogram/Boxplot

A function is defined to create histograms for specified columns in each dataset, helping visualize the data distribution.

### Question 3: Handling Missing Values

Missing values are checked and handled appropriately for each dataset. For example, missing ages in the Titanic dataset are imputed with mean values.

### Question 4: Handling Outliers

The code identifies and handles outliers using various techniques, ensuring data quality.

## Usage

You can use the provided Python code and explanations in this repository to perform similar data preprocessing and visualization tasks on your own datasets. Feel free to adapt and extend the code to suit your specific needs.
